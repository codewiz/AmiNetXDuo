 * advertising 10/100 half and full and no PAUSE (MR4 01e1).  So no link
 * partner ever agreed, whatever its port was set to, and the ring overran
 * instead.  Measured on an A3000 (68060 at 50 MHz, Zorro III) against a
 * TL-SG1016PE port with flow control on, 2026-10-05:
 *
 *     window                 PAUSE agreed   LAN Mbit/s   overruns
 *     8 frames (ring fit)    no             16.6         0
 *     32 frames              no              5.3         410
 *     32 frames              yes            21.9         0
 *     64 frames              yes            16.0-21.3    0
 *
 * So the PHY is told to advertise PAUSE, and while the partner agrees the
 * card answers ANXD_CMD_RX_CAPACITY with the 32 frames that measured best
 * rather than its ring (netdev_nic.h, rx_pause_capacity).
 *
 * The PHY is internal, at MII address 0x10, reached by bit-banging clause 22
 * frames through MEMR: whole-file register 0x14, unpaged like FCR.  MDC is
 * bit 0, MDIR bit 1 (set: the PHY drives MDIO), MDI bit 2 (what it drives),
 * MDO bit 3 (what we drive).  The framing and the edge each bit is set up
 * and sampled on are Linux's mdio-bitbang.c.  No delays: the PHY wants at
 * most 2.5 MHz on MDC, a bit is three bus writes, and a Zorro access is
 * several hundred nanoseconds.  Nothing else in the driver touches MEMR.
